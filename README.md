## 4. Overview
GameKMP is a showcase of modern mobile development, leveraging **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** to share business logic and **Compose Multiplatform** to share UI code across Android and iOS coupled with **Clean Architecture**. It aims to provide a seamless and cohesive user experience for gamers who want to organize their gaming life.

The application allows users to search for games, view detailed statistics, and manage them into personalized collections. Beyond standard lists like "Wishlist" or "Completed," users can create custom collections to organize games their way. A standout feature is the **Personal Rating System**, which lets users rate games effectively and write private reviews, all stored locally for privacy and offline accessibility.

Built with a focus on performance and stability, GameKMP handles complex UI states, nested scrolling, and data persistence gracefully. It demonstrates best practices in KMP development, including dependency injection with Koin, reactive data flows with Coroutines, and type-safe database operations with SQLDelight.
